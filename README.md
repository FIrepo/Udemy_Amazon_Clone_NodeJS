This is the source code from the Udemy NodeJS course that made an Amazon E-Commerce Clone

## Info:
- I haven't run and test all the code due to my busy scheudle but it's a very good review of NodeJS including __Mongodb, Mongoose, ElasticSearch Passport, Stripe, EJS, ajax and JQuery__. 
- The code uses a remote Mongo server called MLab so we don't need to start the mongo server locally. We also need to start the local elasticsearch server to run the search function. 
- We do need to create stripe account and copy the key to the code. 
- All the notes I took are in my OneDrive under "Intense Online Course Study", titled "Build a Amazon Clone
"
